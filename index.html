      <blockquote class="excerpt">The spirit of test-driven development extends beyond writing tests before you write
        code. The goal is to set up a constructive feedback loop for yourself, to identify potential problems quickly
        and give yourself
        the freedom to explore potential improvements. Tests are only a means to that end. Sometimes, you‚Äôll want to set
        tests aside and focus on other sources of feedback. The important thing is to always think ahead: before you
        start writing a piece of code, ask yourself what the most valuable feedback you could receive for that code
        would be. Then take steps to make it a reality.</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="excerpt">Every time your eyes leave your code, you experience what‚Äôs known as a context switch.
        Returning to your code, it‚Äôs common to feel disoriented, even lost. A workflow that requires you to actively
        switch between your code and your tests will sap your ability to focus. Strive to make running your tests as
        automatic as breathing.</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="excerpt">With the new code still fresh in your mind, you can experiment. Try a different
        approach. Use cleaner syntax. Refactor. As soon as you save, the test console will tell you if your revision is
        viable. With just a few extra minutes, you can almost always find a way to make your code better. More
        importantly, what you learn from these little ventures will make you a better coder.</blockquote>
